I am a Postdoctoral Fellow  at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/). My research interests include nondestructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM) based on acoustic emission (AE) sensing technology and signal processing, artificial intelligence techniques, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins. My recent work includes: (1) AE source localization using deep learning; (2) Transfer learning framework combining finite element simulation and domain adaptation; (3) Real-time AE monitoring system for alkali-silicate reaction (ASR) damage in concrete; (4) AE monitoring method applied to stress corrosion cracking in nuclear spent fuel storage systems; (5) Low-velocity impact monitoring framework for urban air mobility; (6) Digital twin for concrete bridges.

I graduated from University of South Carolina (2021) with a PhD in Civil Engineering under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Ziehl](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/ziehl_paul.php). Prior to joining the University of South Carolina, I received my Master's degree in Civil Engineering from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Marcus Rutner](https://www.tuhh.de/mvb/institute/team/prof-dr-marcus-rutner-institutsleiter.html) and [Dr. Sohphia Hassiotis](https://www.stevens.edu/news/stevens-community-celebrates-and-remembers-professor-sophia-hassiotis).
