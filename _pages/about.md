Hey, there! My name is Li Ai. I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/). I am currently working at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Department of Civil&Environmental Engineering, and the [McNAIR Aerospace Center](https://sc.edu/about/centers_institutes/mcnair/index.php). I received my PhD from the University of South Carolina in 2021 under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Ziehl](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/ziehl_paul.php). I received my Master from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in 2016 under the supervision of [Dr. Marcus Rutner](https://www.tuhh.de/mvb/institute/team/prof-dr-marcus-rutner-institutsleiter.html) and [Dr. Sohphia Hassiotis](https://www.stevens.edu/news/stevens-community-celebrates-and-remembers-professor-sophia-hassiotis).
